This program can read MOLPRO output files and find any errors or other problems, like unconverged Hartree-Fock.
To use the program, compile it using g++ -o err main.cc and run it using "err <jobname> <T1 diagnostic cutoff> <ycp/nocp> <T1 diagnostic cutoff for counterpoise>".

If you use a ab-initio method that gives you a T1 diagnostic, you can enter a cutoff value. Meaning that values lower than the cutoff value will be ignored.
Do remember that values of T1 higher than 0.02 are considered unreliable.
During execution of the program you will be asked to enter the number of methods performed that give out T1 diagnostics.
Please note that e.g. the CCSD(T) will count for 2, as an RMP2 calculation is performed prior to the CCSD(T) calculation.

If you use a BSSE correction (counterpoise correction) in your MOLPRO program, you can choose to ignore these by using the nocp option.
Alternatively you can use ycp and give a separate option for the T1 cutoff for the BSSE correction calculations.
If you use no option, then the BSSE will be evaluated with the same T1 diagnostic as entered before.
